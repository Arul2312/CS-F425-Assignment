# Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KAN) - Reimplementation

This repository contains a custom implementation of the **Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KAN)**, based on the paper _["Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks" (arXiv:2401.01416)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01416)_. The KAN model introduces a novel neural network architecture that replaces traditional neuron-based activations with **grid-based spline interpolations**, enabling better interpretability, efficiency, and flexibility.

>  This project was done as part of the CS F425 - Deep Learning course project.
